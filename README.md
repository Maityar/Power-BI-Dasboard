# Power-BI-Dashboard

This Power BI project was developed as part of the "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" course by Maven Analytics, Aaron Parry and Chris Dutton on Udemy. 
It showcases my proficiency in using Power BI to create interactive and informative dashboards for business intelligence purposes.

The project aims to provide actionable insights for AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company, by developing a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard. The dashboard focuses on tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns. It enables regional performance comparisons, product-level trend analysis, and the identification of high-value customers to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Features:

 • Connect and transform the raw data
 • Build a relational data model
 • Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
 • Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data
