# Power-BI-Dashboard

This Power BI project was developed as part of the "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" course by Maven Analytics, Aaron Parry and Chris Dutton on Udemy. 
It showcases my proficiency in using Power BI to create interactive and informative dashboards for business intelligence purposes.

The project aims to provide actionable insights for AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company, by developing a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard. The dashboard focuses on tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns. It enables regional performance comparisons, product-level trend analysis, and the identification of high-value customers to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Features:

 • Connect and transform the raw data
 
 • Build a relational data model
 
 • Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
 
 • Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data

Business Takeaways and Recommendations:

 • The most returned product type is shirts, while clothing is the least ordered product category.
 I recommend AdventureWorks to evaluate the performance of the clothing category. If the category is not profitable or strategic, consider reducing its offerings. However, if there's potential for improvement, implementing targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations could boost sales and reduce returns.
 
 •  The accessories category is leading in sales, with the lowest return rate. it's an oppurtinity to leverage the popularity of the accessories category, increase sales, and improve overall customer satisfaction by using different strategies to further optimize this category. For example, expanding the accessory range by introducing a wider variety of products that complement the core offerings.
 
 • The most significant portion of orders is coming from the USA. It could indicate a promising market opportunity, which can be leveraged by implementing effective inventory management strategies to meet US demand and developing targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with the US audience.

 • As the customer base grows, revenue per customer is declining, suggesting a shift towards lower-priced products or less frequent purchases. I suggest evaluating pricing strategies to optimize revenue and profitability, while optimizing the customer experience to encourage repeat purchases.
